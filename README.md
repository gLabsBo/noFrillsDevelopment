NoFrillsDev

This Matlab pipeline uses a Macbeth colorchecker to correct the colors of an image.
In order to do that, it uses
DC_RAW or RAWTHERAPEE to read a raw file
ccFind to identify a Macbeth colorchecker target in the image
White balance is performed in window mode in dcRaw. 
TODO in RAWTHERAPEE
Image is then color corrected using different approaches:
1) polyfit - weighted polyfit
2) spline based fitting (based on SLMtools)
3) SHAFT, that is a trial and error approach freely inspired by Adobe Camera Raw script

USAGE
Launch noFrillsDevelopment.m to process a file or a folder containing raw images with detectable colorchecker
